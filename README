FBPAD
=====

Fbpad is a small linux framebuffer virtual terminal.  It manages many
terminals through single-letter tags; each tag can hold two terminals.
The following table indicates fbpad's key-bindings (m-k means pressing
k, while holding the alt key).

==============  =======================================
key		command
==============  =======================================
m-c		execute a shell (SHELL)
m-m		execute mail program (MAIL)
m-e		execute editor program (EDITOR)
m-x 		switch to tag 'x' (TAGS)
m-j		switch to current tag's alternative terminal
m-k		like m-j
m-p		show tag summary
m-o		jump to the previous tag
m-tab		show the next terminal
m-s		create a text screenshot (SCRSHOT)
m-y		redraw the terminal
c-m-l		lock the screen; use PASS to unlock
c-m-o		disable/enable tag switching
c-m-q		quit fbpad
m-,		scroll up
m-.		scroll down
==============  =======================================

Fbpad can be instructed to execute a single program: the program and
its arguments should passed as command line arguments of fbpad.  Fbpad
executes this program in a terminal, disables all terminal switching
commands, and exits as soon as the program finishes.


SETTING UP
==========

To configure fbpad, you should edit config.h.  To get fbpad running
you need to make sure FR points to a valid tinyfont file (for testing
you can try http://litcave.rudi.ir/courr.tf) and SHELL to the shell
you want fbpad to execute.  Also the type of fbval_t should match the
framebuffer depth: unsigned char for 8-bit, short for 16-bit and int
for 24/32-bit framebuffers.  Once these are set, you should be able to
start fbpad without problems.

Fbpad uses tinyfont files, which can be created using ft2tf program
(http://litcave.rudi.ir/).  The FR, FI and FB macros specify the path
of the tinyfont files for regular, italic and bold fonts.  If FI or FB
is NULL, the regular font is used for italic or bold text.

Next you may want to change the list of fbpad tags by changing TAGS.
FGCOLOR and BGCOLOR macros specify foreground and background colors,
for instance the FGCOLOR of 2 and BGCOLOR of 0 creates green on black
terminals.  Individual colors can be customized by editing the hex RGB
color description of COLOR* macros.  Also SCRSHOT macro specifies where
fbpad text screenshots, as created using "m-s" command, should be saved.

If you are want to use fbpad's scrsnap feature, you can edit TAGS_SAVED
to change the list of saved terminals.  Framebuffer memory is saved and
reloaded for these tags, which is very convenient when you are using
programs that change the framebuffer simultaneously, like fbpdf.

256-COLOR MODE
==============

Fbpad supports xterm's 256-color extension, but most programs will not
use this extension, unless the $TERM terminfo entry declares this
feature.  For this purpose, you need to create fbpad-256 terminfo file
containing (ignore the two-space identation):

  fbpad-256,
  	use=linux, U8#0,
  	colors#256,
  	pairs#32767,
  	setab=\E[%?%p1%{8}%<%t4%p1%d%e%p1%{16}%<%t10%p1%{8}%-%d%e48;5;%p1%d%;m,
  	setaf=\E[%?%p1%{8}%<%t3%p1%d%e%p1%{16}%<%t9%p1%{8}%-%d%e38;5;%p1%d%;m,

And install it with:

  $ tic -x ./fbpad-256

Now you can add this line to your shell startup script:

  export TERM=fbpad-256

Note that in order to use this feature and italic fonts in Vim, adding
fbpad-256 terminfo is not necessary.  Including the following lines in
your vimrc should enable them:

  set t_ZH=[3m
  set t_Co=256
